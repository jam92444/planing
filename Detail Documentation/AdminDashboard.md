## üìò Module Documentation: **F. Admin Dashboard**

---

## üß© 1. Purpose

The **Admin Dashboard** is a secure area for **store administrators** to:

* Manage products and inventory
* Configure store-level settings (logo, receipt size, currency, etc.)
* (Optionally) Manage cashier/admin users
* Access sales analytics and top product insights

---

## üßë‚Äçüíº 2. Who is an Admin?

An **Admin** is a privileged user with full access to:

* Product CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* Store branding & settings
* Billing history & analytics
* User management (if multi-user enabled)

Other users (e.g., cashiers) will have **limited access**: only billing and bill history.
