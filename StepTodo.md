## âœ… Ultimate Development Roadmap for `billGenerator` (SaaS POS Billing App)

This roadmap assumes you're building a **multi-tenant SaaS** application, starting from MVP and scaling to production.

---

### ðŸš§ **Phase 1 â€“ Foundation (MVP Core Functionality)**

âœ… Goal: Build a working, basic POS app for a single store with login, billing, product management.

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 1.1 â€“ Setup & Project Structure

* [ ] Setup backend (Express + MongoDB + Cloudinary + basic JWT auth)
* [ ] Setup frontend (React + Tailwind + routing + API client)
* [ ] Setup code structure for multi-module app (`controllers/`, `services/`, `routes/`, etc.)
* [ ] Configure `.env` files, base config, Cloudinary setup
* [ ] GitHub repo ready with folders: `backend/`, `frontend/`, `planning/`

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 1.2 â€“ Authentication & Basic Authorization

* [ ] User signup/login with hashed passwords
* [ ] JWT generation and verification
* [ ] Protect API routes with middleware
* [ ] Store `store_id` in user profile and derive it from token
* [ ] Roles: basic (`owner`, `cashier`)

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 1.3 â€“ Store Setup & Branding

* [ ] API to create & update a store (name, logo, currency, tax settings)
* [ ] Cloudinary integration to upload logo
* [ ] Ensure store branding info is fetched for each request
* [ ] Enforce store isolation (`store_id` filter everywhere)

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 1.4 â€“ Product & Inventory Management

* [ ] CRUD operations for products
* [ ] Product variants support (e.g. size, color)
* [ ] Stock management per product/variant
* [ ] Image upload via Cloudinary
* [ ] Unique label ID generation per store

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 1.5 â€“ Billing System (Simple Sale)

* [ ] Cart system: select products/variants
* [ ] Tax & discount calculation logic
* [ ] Generate and store a bill (sale type only)
* [ ] Store as PDF or printable HTML
* [ ] Retrieve past bills

### ðŸš€ **Phase 2 â€“ Multi-Tenant SaaS Conversion**

âœ… Goal: Convert the app to fully support multiple stores + add subscription billing.

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 2.1 â€“ True Multi-Tenant Support

* [ ] Tenant isolation middleware
* [ ] Scoped queries (always filtered by `store_id`)
* [ ] Prevent cross-store access via token

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 2.2 â€“ Subscription Management

* [ ] Integrate Stripe (or Razorpay)
* [ ] Create free/premium/enterprise plans in Stripe
* [ ] Backend webhook listener for subscription events
* [ ] Store current plan info in each store record
* [ ] Enforce usage limits based on plan (e.g. number of products, bills/month)

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 2.3 â€“ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

* [ ] Define roles: owner, cashier
* [ ] Add role to user profile
* [ ] Middleware to restrict access (e.g. only owner can update store settings)

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 2.4 â€“ Add Billing History & Exchange Flow

* [ ] Implement exchange/return logic
* [ ] Fetch original bill, allow return of items
* [ ] Calculate difference (refund or extra charge)
* [ ] Update stock levels
* [ ] Link exchange bill to original

### ðŸ§  **Phase 3 â€“ Performance, Reliability, and UX**

âœ… Goal: Make app scalable, user-friendly, and robust.

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 3.1 â€“ Redis Integration

* [ ] Setup Redis (via Upstash or other)
* [ ] Cache store settings and branding
* [ ] Use Redis to track usage (e.g. bill count per store)
* [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 3.2 â€“ Invoice / Receipt Generation

* [ ] Add support for printable receipts
* [ ] Custom branding per store
* [ ] Option to download PDF (server-side using Puppeteer or client-side with PDFMake)

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 3.3 â€“ Reporting & Analytics

* [ ] Sales history filters (by date, product, user)
* [ ] Daily/weekly/monthly sales summary
* [ ] Export to CSV / PDF

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 3.4 â€“ Dashboard UX Polish

* [ ] Add loading states, toasts, error handling
* [ ] Mobile responsive POS UI
* [ ] Pagination + search for products, bills

### ðŸ”’ **Phase 4 â€“ Security, Testing, & Deployment**

âœ… Goal: Harden the system, prepare for real-world users.

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 4.1 â€“ Security

* [ ] Input validation (Yup/Joi)
* [ ] File type & size checks for uploads
* [ ] HTTPS everywhere
* [ ] CORS config
* [ ] Email/password reset flow

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 4.2 â€“ Testing

* [ ] Unit tests for services
* [ ] Integration tests for APIs (Jest + Supertest)
* [ ] E2E tests (Cypress or Playwright)

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 4.3 â€“ CI/CD & Deployment

* [ ] GitHub Actions for linting + tests
* [ ] Deploy frontend to Vercel or Netlify
* [ ] Deploy backend to Render / Railway / Fly.io
* [ ] MongoDB Atlas setup with backups
* [ ] Monitor with Upptime / Sentry / LogRocket

### ðŸ§± **Phase 5 â€“ Advanced Features**

âœ… Goal: Add enterprise-level features, improve monetization.

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 5.1 â€“ Team Management per Store

* [ ] Invite other users (cashiers) to store
* [ ] Assign roles
* [ ] View team activity (audit trail)

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 5.2 â€“ Offline Mode (Optional)

* [ ] Cache products in browser
* [ ] Sync queued bills when back online

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 5.3 â€“ API Access for Store Owners (Optional)
