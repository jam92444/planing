## üñºÔ∏è 3. Receipt Size Selection (New Enhancement)

### ‚úÖ Real-World Need

Different businesses need **different receipt sizes**:

| Business Type      | Common Receipt Size  |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Clothing shops     | 55mm thermal, A5     |
| Electronics stores | A4                   |
| Jewelry            | A5, custom           |
| Railways/hospitals | Full-width (A4)      |
| Caf√©/Food stalls   | 55mm or 80mm thermal |

---

### üßæ Supported Receipt Sizes (In App)

| Label               | Size (approx) | Use Case                            |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `55mm`              | 2.1 inches    | Thermal receipt printers (most POS) |
| `A5`                | 5.8 x 8.3 in  | Half-page print                     |
| `A4`                | 8.3 x 11.7 in | Full bill, formal invoice           |
| `Custom` (optional) | Dynamic       | Use CSS scale & margins             |

---

### üì¶ Config Options

**Option 1 ‚Äì On Each Bill:**

- Cashier chooses desired receipt size (from dropdown)
- App renders correct layout for selected size

**Option 2 ‚Äì Store Settings:**

- Default receipt size stored per store
- Can override per-bill if needed

> We recommend both. Default in settings + override on each bill.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Implement (Frontend)

#### Receipt Layout

Use different CSS classes or print layouts:

```tsx
<div className={`receipt-preview ${receiptSize}`}>{/* Receipt layout */}</div>
```

**CSS:**

```css
.receipt-55mm {
  width: 55mm;
  font-size: 10px;
}

.receipt-a5 {
  width: 148mm;
  font-size: 12px;
}

.receipt-a4 {
  width: 210mm;
  font-size: 14px;
}
```

> You can dynamically load styles based on selected size.

---

### üñ®Ô∏è Print Logic

Use a library or window print with print CSS:

- `window.print()` with media query
- Or use [`react-to-print`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-to-print)
- Or generate PDF with [`jsPDF`](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF) for A4/A5

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 4. Data Model: Bill Schema (MongoDB)

```js
// models/Bill.js

const BillSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  store_id: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Store" },
  type: { type: String, enum: ["sale", "exchange"], default: "sale" },
  items: [
    {
      label_id: String,
      name: String,
      size: String,
      quantity: Number,
      price: Number,
      discount: {
        type: Number,
        default: 0,
      },
      discount_type: {
        type: String,
        enum: ["percent", "fixed"],
        default: "percent",
      },
    },
  ],
  subtotal: Number,
  tax: Number,
  total: Number,
  discount_total: Number,
  receipt_size: { type: String, default: "55mm" },
  created_at: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
});
```
