## Integration Notes

- **Multi-store support** requires extending the `store_id` logic to allow one user to belong to multiple stores with permission levels.
- **Mobile version** can be a React Native app or PWA to reuse existing React codebase.
- **Loyalty system** will need new collections like `customers`, `loyalty_points`, and APIs for managing customer data.
- **Offline mode** will require local storage, service workers, and conflict resolution strategies on sync.
- **Receipts via SMS/WhatsApp** involves integrating with SMS gateways (e.g., Twilio) or WhatsApp Business API, and generating shareable receipt links or PDFs.
